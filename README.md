# Java and POO

This repository is of me getting started in object oriented programming using the legendary JAVA programming language.

Now, if you excuse me, I will go brew myself a cup of coffee and then study data types, control strucutres, repetition structures, arrays. 
Next week or so, we will be starting OOP properly

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in OOP that simplify and streamline software development. Classes act as blueprints or templates for creating objects, while objects represent instances of these classes.

**Classes:**

* Define the blueprint for objects, outlining their characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
* Encapsulate data and methods, promoting data integrity and maintainability.
* Can be used as building blocks to create complex systems through inheritance and polymorphism.

**Objects:**

* Instances of classes, representing real-world entities or abstract concepts.
* Possess specific values for their attributes, and can execute the defined methods.

**Abstraction:**

* Focuses on the essential characteristics of an object, omitting irrelevant details.
* Acts as a simplified representation, like a blueprint for a house that cannot be inhabited but provides a clear structure.
* Enables developers to work with concepts without getting bogged down in intricate implementation details.
